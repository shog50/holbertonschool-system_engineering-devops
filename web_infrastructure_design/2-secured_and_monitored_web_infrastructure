# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

## Architecture Diagram

## Components
- **Firewalls (3)**: Protect each server from unauthorized access.
- **SSL Certificate**: Enables HTTPS for encrypted traffic to www.foobar.com.
- **Monitoring Clients (3)**: Collect metrics and logs from servers for tools like Sumologic.

## Benefits
- Secured traffic and servers.
- Monitoring provides insights into system health and QPS (queries per second).

## Issues
- **SSL termination at Load Balancer**: Backend traffic may be unencrypted if not configured properly.
- **Single MySQL writable node**: Limits scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Servers with same components**: Resource contention, harder to maintain.
