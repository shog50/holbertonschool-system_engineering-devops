# Distributed Web Infrastructure

## Architecture Diagram
## Components
- **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**: Distributes incoming requests to multiple servers.
  - Distribution Algorithm: Round-robin (evenly distributes requests).
  - Setup: Active-Active (both load balancers handle traffic simultaneously).
- **Web/App Servers (2 servers)**: Each has Nginx, app server, application files, and MySQL.
- **Database**: Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) setup.
  - Primary handles writes.
  - Replica handles reads.

## Benefits
- Reduces SPOF for web servers.
- Can scale horizontally by adding more servers.

## Issues
- **SPOF**: Load balancer itself can fail if not clustered.
- **Security**: No firewall or HTTPS implemented.
- **Monitoring**: Not included yet.
