# Simple Web Stack

## Architecture Diagram


## Components
- **Domain Name**: www.foobar.com points to IP 8.8.8.8 using a **CNAME/A record**.
- **Server**: Physical or virtual machine hosting all components.
- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles HTTP requests and serves static content.
- **Application Server**: Runs dynamic code and business logic.
- **Application Files**: The code base for the website.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Stores and retrieves data for the application.

## Communication
- The user requests `www.foobar.com`, DNS resolves to the server IP.
- Browser communicates via HTTP with the web server, which forwards dynamic requests to the app server.
- The app server queries the database if needed and returns results to the web server.

## Issues
- **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**: Only one server; if it fails, the site is down.
- **Downtime during maintenance**: Restarting the server or web server causes outage.
- **Scalability limits**: Cannot handle high traffic efficiently.
